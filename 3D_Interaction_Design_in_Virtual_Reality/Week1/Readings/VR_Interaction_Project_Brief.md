# VR Interaction Project Brief

As part of this course you will do a project that will be to develop an interactive VR experience. This is the rubric for the project. 

You should submit a unity project with a scene that can be viewed in VR, that represents a real or imaginary environment (it does not have to be realistic, it could be a fantasy or abstract environment) and supports interaction including a navigation method and object interaction

You will do the project in two parts, with submissions in weeks 2 and 4. In week 2 you will submit work in progress and in week 4 you will submit the final version. The requirements for week 4 will build on the requirements for week 4. 

The requirements for week 2 are:

- You should have a brief description of your project
- This description should give instructions
- The description should give any restrictions on hardware needed to run the scene
- The project should contain a simple 3D scene with objects
- The scene should be viewable in VR
- You should have a mechanism for moving around the scene beyond the walkable area of your VR set up
- The movement system should be designed to avoid nausea

The requirements for week 4 include the requirements for week 2 and in addition are:

- The project should include a mechanism for selecting objects in the scene
- The project should include a way of manipulating object that are selecting or triggering actions on those object
- The object interaction methods should be realistic or magical 
- The project can include an additional interaction method beyond navigation and object interaction (e.g. a Graphical User Interface)
