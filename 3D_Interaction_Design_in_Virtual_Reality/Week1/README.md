# Interaction in VR

Welcome to Week 1! In this week, we will cover interaction in VR. You will discover different types of interaction, and how interaction works with different HMDs. We'll end the week by introducing you to this MOOC's project.

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss new challenges in 3D interaction in Virtual Reality as compared to 2D interaction or non-VR 3D interaction
- Distinguish between active and passive user input
- Compare technical features of existing HMD hardware in terms of tracking
- Explain basic concepts and hardware for user input in VR
- Compare magic interaction and natural interaction
