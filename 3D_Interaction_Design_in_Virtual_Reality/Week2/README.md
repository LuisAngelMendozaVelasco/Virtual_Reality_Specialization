# Moving around in VR

Welcome to Week 2! This week, we'll cover moving around in VR. We'll look at physical navigation, such as walk-in-place, and virtual navigation, such as teleportation. You will end the week by beginning your project, and submitting your work in progress.

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss basic 3D navigation
- Distinguish between physical and virtual navigation
- Compare different physical (real walking, redirected walking, walk-in-place) and virtual (virtual, teleporting) navigation methods
- Evaluate VR navigation methods with quality factors
- Create a VR environment where users can move around the scene beyond the walkable area of the VR set up
- Design basic VR navigation with head position/rotation + button interaction
