# Interacting with Objects in VR

Welcome to Week 3! This week, we will be looking at interacting with objects in VR. We'll cover topics such as interacting with objects within reach, hyper-natural interaction, and magic interaction. We'll then move on to physics interaction, and how this works in VR.

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss basic object interaction in VR
- Explain object interaction with the "real hand" metaphor
- Compare different hyper-natural and magic interaction methods
- Evaluate object interaction method depending on application
- Summarize the fundamental properties of physics for VR Interaction
- Summarize the fundamental properties of state machines for VR Interaction
- Select between physics and state machine interaction as appropriate to the needs of a particular project
