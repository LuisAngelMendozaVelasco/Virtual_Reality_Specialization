# Challenges in VR interaction and User Interfaces in VR

Welcome to Week 4! In the final week of this MOOC, we'll be looking at challenges in VR interaction, and user interfaces in VR. You'll begin by learning about graphical user interfaces in VR, including abstract interfaces and diegetic and non-diegetic UI, before moving on to designing VR interaction.

## Learning Objectives

- Design and implement graphical user interfaces for VR
- Design a diegetic user interface for VR
- Evaluate a VR experience
- Design and implement an interactive VR experience
