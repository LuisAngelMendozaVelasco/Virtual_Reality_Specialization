The Oculus GO is an HMD that was announced and released by Oculus after the launch of this course, so we don't have a video, but this is a summary.

The Oculus GO is a mobile VR platform that is very similar to the Samsung Gear VR (in fact they can run exactly the same software). However, it is completely stand along, it does not need a mobile phone to be inserted into it, all the hardware is in the HMD. 

That makes it a very cheap and easy way to get into VR. At $100 it is a bit more expensive than the Gear VR, but you don't need to buy an expensive Samsung phone. That means it is likely to be a a popular gateway to VR. 

However, as a mobile platform, it is less capable than a high end VR platform, and in particular does not support position tracking.
