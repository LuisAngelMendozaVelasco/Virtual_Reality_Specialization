# HMD | Oculus Quest

The Oculus Quest is an HMD that was announced and released by Oculus after the launch of this course, so we don't have a video, but this is a summary.

The Oculus Quest is a stand alone mobile VR platform. That means that like the Samsung Gear VR, it does not have to be connected to a computer, and unlike the GearVR it does not even need a mobile phone.  

However, it is unlike the mobile VR platforms discussed in the course. That is because it is the first mobile VR headset to implement the innovation that Sylvia predicted: Inside out tracking. That means that it can do position tracking (and therefore 6DOF) of the headset without the external cameras used by the Rift and VIVE, but with cameras on the HMD itself. This also allows it to have tracked 6DOF hand controllers. 

This makes it the equivalent of what we have called "High end VR" but in a mobile package. That is quite a breakthrough and we think it will have a big impact on the VR industry.
