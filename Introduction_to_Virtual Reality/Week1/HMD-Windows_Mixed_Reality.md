# HMD | Windows Mixed Reality

Windows Mixed Reality is a VR platform that was released after this course was launched, so we don't have a video, but here is a summary. 

You can also read about Windows Mixed Reality on the Microsoft Website:

Windows MR (as it is often called) was released by Microsoft in Autumn 2017, and it is built into the latest version of Windows 10. It is an open platform in the sense that anyone can develop a headset. This is similar to Microsoft's normal strategy, they don't develop proprietary computers (like Apple) but build a platform (Windows) that can be used by many hardware developers. They have worked with a number of hardware companies who have released headsets, which you can see below:

Windows MR is a 6DOF platform that supports both rotation and position tracking in the headset as well as two position tracked controllers that are similar to the HTC VIVE controllers or the Oculus Touch. One of the biggest innovations is that it uses inside-out tracking. The position tracking is done using cameras on the front of the HMD, not external cameras. This makes the set up a lot easier. 

Windows MR head sets have very similar capabilities to other high end VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC VIVE and it is a good third option for high end VR.

For example, we have tested the [ACER Mixed Reality Headset](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/wmr), which features an innovative design, but otherwise feels very comparable to the Rift and VIVE.
