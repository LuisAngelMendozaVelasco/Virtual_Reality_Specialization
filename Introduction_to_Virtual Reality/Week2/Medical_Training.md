# Medical Training

Here is the video mentioned in the lecture, where we used VR to train medical doctors to deal with demanding patients. 

This video is provided for your interest and isn't required watching. Sorry if it is not available in your territory and that the subtitling is not as complete as in our lecture videos (only the virtual characters are subtitled).

In the video several medical doctors are talking to virtual patients who are strongly demanding antibiotics. The doctors' responses are very similar to how they would interact in real patients and they are clearly under stress and social pressure similar to that in the real situation.
