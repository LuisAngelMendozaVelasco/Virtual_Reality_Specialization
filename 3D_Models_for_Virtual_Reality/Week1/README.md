# 3D Graphics

This week you will begin developing 3D Virtual Reality Environments. We will cover the basics of 3D graphics, including a number of 3D engines and development environments that you can use. We will particularly focus on the Unity3D engine.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the different components that make up 3D objects and environments
- Choose appropriate 3D development environments for a projects
- Use the basic functions of Unity3D
- Create and use 3D Mesh based Objects
- Use 3D coordinates to navigate a 3D scene
