# Setting Up Unity

Now take some time to set up the unity development environment. 

Download unity from their website (you can use the free Personal edition for everything in this course):

Unity is free and normally easy to set up on a relatively modern PC or Mac. 

Once you have installed it, you can try the first tutorial to check that it works and you can use it:

Once you have started unity, you will get a splash screen that lets you open a project, you should select "new" in the top right hand corner.
