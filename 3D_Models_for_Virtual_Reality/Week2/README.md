# VR Graphics

In this module you will carry on learning about 3D graphics, including how to use transforms to lay out a 3D scene and how to use materials to give your objects a distinctive appearance. You will also submit the first draft of your project.

## Learning Objectives

- Create simple 3D VR worlds
- Use textures to enhance the appearance of 3D objects
- Use transforms to lay out a objects into a 3D scene
- Describe the role of lights, textures and materials in creating the appearance of an object
- Describe the role of transforms in constructing a 3D scene
- Use the basic functionality of Unity3D
- Choose appropriate graphics techniques for a particular situation
