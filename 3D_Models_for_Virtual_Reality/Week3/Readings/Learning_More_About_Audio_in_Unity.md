# Learning More About Audio in Unity

As usual, the best place to start with learning unity audio, is with the tutorials page:

https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/audio

and the manual:

https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Audio.html

In my lecture I mentioned AudioGaming, who produce procedural audio tools. You can find their website here:

You might also want to find audio files to use in your projects. If you are doing so it is very important that you use audio that you have the rights to. You can find audio on the Unity Asset Store, but another good site is free sound, which provides creative commons licensed audio:
