# Further Learning in Unity

The unity documentation is the best place to start, particularly the tutorials:

https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials

and the manual:

https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html

Example projects are a great place to start, and you can find many on the asset store, I would recommend you look at the VR Samples project:

You can of course, look at other MOOCs, Game Design and Development by Michigan State University will give you a deeper understanding of unity
