# Welcome

This week you will start the process of creating your first VR Game. We will explain the steps you will go through when you're creating the game and you will start thinking of your idea. You will also meet our experts who will be explaining their VR projects and giving advice to you.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop an idea for a VR game or project.
- Assess your project idea in terms of the many factors that are important in VR such as presence, graphics, interaction, characters and comfort.
- Plan your work based on an understanding of the tasks involved in developing a VR project.
