# How You Will Learn In This Course

Unlike other courses in this specialisation, this course isn't about teaching you a lot of facts, theories or techniques. It is about you getting the opportunity to practice and develop your skills by creating a project of your own. 

That means you won't be learning by listening to us, but by working on your project. You will get a deeper understanding of VR creation through the discoveries you make as you create your project. You will have a unique learning journey that follows the challenges of your own development. 

Having said that, we won't just leave you on your own. This course will support you in four ways: inspiration, guidance, feedback and reflection.

## Inspiration

You will have already seen some interviews with our VR experts and a case study projects. We will have interviews and case studies throughout the course so you can see different ideas that we hope will inspire you. After each set interviews there will be a discussion for you to share you ideas with other learners and see what they thought. 

## Guidance

Developing a VR game is a lot of work and involves a lot of tasks. If you are just beginning it is hard to know all the things you need to do and think about. We will use activities to guide you through the process. 

Each week there will be a reflective quiz that will ask you a number of questions to guide your work on your project, making you think about the key issues that you need to address that week. 

We will also ask you to prepare a to do list each week, with the task you need to do before the next week. It will be an opportunity to reflect on what you have done that week and what you need to do next. 

## Feedback

Every week you will do a peer review. This will act as a deadline for your work that week and an opportunity to get feedback from other learners. That means at each stage you can see how other students are doing and also get valuable feedback about your own work. 

You will also get more informal feedback on your ideas in our discussion forums. 

## Reflection

To really learn from doing a project, it is important that you take time to think and reflect on your process. What things went well and what could have gone better. This is key to thinking about how to improve in future. 

We have made reflective quizzes to guide you through your own private reflection (including things you might not want to share) and discussion forums as an opportunity to reflect and discuss the issues with other learners.
