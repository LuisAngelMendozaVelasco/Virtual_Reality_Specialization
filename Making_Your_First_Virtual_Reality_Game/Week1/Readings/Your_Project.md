# Your Project

In this course you will work on your first complete VR project: developing a VR game. 

That means the course is based around developing real world skills through doing rather than factual knowledge. 

The project will be a game (or “serious game” type VR experience) that should work in VR. The main criteria are:

- It should work in VR
- It should have a gameplay mechanic suited to VR 
- It should have interaction techniques suited to VR
- It should have a suitable graphical style for VR. 

We will guide you through the process of developing your VR experience through a number of steps. Each week you will do a different task in the process:

1. Coming up with your project idea
2. Developing the game concept with a storyboard
3. Developing an initial prototype to test your gameplay mechnic
4. Testing your prototype with users
5. Implementing the final project, fixing bugs, refining the interaction and implementing the graphics
6. Finishing your implementation and submitting the final project.
