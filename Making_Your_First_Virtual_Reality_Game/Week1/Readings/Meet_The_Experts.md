# Meet The Experts

When you start working on your game and are looking for inspiration, it is a good idea to see a wide range of other projects that people have been doing. 

Sylvia and Marco can give you one view point, but to really  develop yourself as a VR creator you need to be able to see many different viewpoints and project ideas. That is why, for this course, we have interviewed VR experts from all over the world. These include veterans with over 3 decades experiences and some of the new generation of VR developers creating new and exciting projects. They include old friends and collaborators of ours and also new friends that we have met at conferences and industry events. 

We have asked them to describe their work and to give their advice to you, so you can benefit from their insights. 

We have also prepared a number of longer case studies of VR projects which can give you greater insight into the process. 

Each week we will show some of these interviews and then ask you to reflect on them, sharing what inspired you in the talks with other learners.
