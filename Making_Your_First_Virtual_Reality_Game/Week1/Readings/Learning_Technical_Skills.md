# Learning Technical Skills

This course will guide you through the process of creating your first VR Game, but the technical skills you will need to develop that game are taught in the 
[previous courses in this specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/virtual-reality). 

[Introduction to Virtual Reality](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-virtual-reality) takes you through the basics of VR, including the technology and psychology of the experience. This is vital knowledge for developing VR, but the course does not teach any specific technical skills. 

[3D Models for Virtual Reality](https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-models-virtual-reality) teaches the basics of creating 3D environments in VR and introduces the Unity3D engine. 

[3D Interaction Design in Virtual Reality](https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-interaction-design-virtual-reality) shows you how to develop the interaction techniques that are vital for VR, including headsets and controllers to move around and interact with object. 

[Building Interactive 3D Characters and Social VR](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-3d-characters-social-virtual-reality) is about characters in VR and particularly how to create them so they support social interaction. 

We would recommend you take all of these courses before starting on your project, you might also want to deepen your skills with other courses, for example this [Game Design and Development Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-development) from Michigan State.
