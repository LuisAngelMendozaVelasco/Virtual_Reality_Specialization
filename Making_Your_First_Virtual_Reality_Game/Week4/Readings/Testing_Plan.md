# Testing Plan

Before you start testing your game with users, it is important to have a clear plan for testing. This plan needs to cover the following elements:

## What are you testing?

- What aspects of the game are you testing? It is better to start with the key mechanic first?
- What do you want to find out? It is best to explain this in terms of a number of questions such as: do players enjoy the game? Are there any difficult or confusing parts? Do the players feel presence?
- Will you be comparing two different versions of your game? This is a really good way to see which mechanics work best.

## Who are you testing with?

- How will your testers be?
- Do they reflect your target audience or are they different?
- Are they a diverse group in terms of age, gender, background, experience of VR and games, or are they all quite similar
- Are there any who raise ethical issues (see below)

## What data are you collecting?

- What types of data will you collect? Questionnaire results, interviews, video or audio recordings
- What questions will you ask in interviews or questionnaires?
- Will the data be enough to find out the information you want from your tests?

## What are the ethical issues?

- You need to make sure that your participants give signed consent for testing and data collection. 
- By default you should keep any data private and should ask if you want to publish it. If the data you want to publish is not anonymous, i.e. the tester can be identified from it, you need to make that very clear and you need to ask for explicit consent.
- VR experiences can cause discomfort and nausea, you should end the testing as soon as any tester feels nausea. Your consent form should warn testers about these side effects and include a comment saying that they may stop at any time. 
- Some people may not be able to give legal consent because they do not understand what is being asked or they are not able to make that decision for themselves, for example children or people with certain disabilities or mental health conditions, so you should not include them as testers. 
- What risks are their in doing the tests? Even if the risks for health adults is low there may be risks for certain groups with physical or mental health issues (e.g. heart problems or risk of panic attacks) or pregnant women. 
- In general you should only use health adults as testers and avoid children, pregnant women and people with severe physical or mental health issues or disabilities. If your target audience includes any of these at risk groups, test with an alternative health adult group (and only test with at risk groups later if you have medical approval)
