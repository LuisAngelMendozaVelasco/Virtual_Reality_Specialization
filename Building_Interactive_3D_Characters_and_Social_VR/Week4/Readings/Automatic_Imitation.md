# Automatic Imitation

A lot of research work has been conducted in the area of automatic imitation - the fact that we are hardwired to automatically copy each other to some extent. This has been explored both at high levels (mimicry in social interaction) and low levels (we are faster to open our fits when we see somebody else also doing the same thing, than when seeing the opposite) .

Here is some work I have done in studying automatic imitation works, using virtual characters. It turns out we have the tendency to also copy virtual characters - just the way we automatically copy another human being!
