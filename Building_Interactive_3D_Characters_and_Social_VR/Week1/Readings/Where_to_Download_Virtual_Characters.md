# Where to Download Virtual Characters

As always with unity, the best place to look for virtual characters is the asset store. You can look in the 3D Models-> Characters category (NB unfortunately, the character used in some of the tutorials MCSMale, is no longer available).

Make sure the characters are mecanim compatible and have blend shapes. 

We recommend the asset store, but there are also other sites, like turbo squid:

If you look outside the asset store you need to make sure that the results are compatible with unity. They should be rigged, have blend shapes (also called morphs) and be available in fox format. 

Adobe Fuse is good software for creating and customising realistic human characters, which is currently free to use:

Daz3D is a good alternative:

Getting characters into unity can be a bit tricky but there is a tutorial here:
