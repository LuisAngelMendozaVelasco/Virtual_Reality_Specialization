# Introduction to Virtual Characters

In this module you will start to learn about the role of human-like characters in VR. Characters can represent other real people: avatars, or they can be computer controlled: agents. Either way they are the very foundation of social interaction in VR.

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss virtual character appearance and behavioural realism
- Distinguish avatars and agents
- Identify features to consider when desgining interactive character animation
- Give examples of useful applications with virtual characters
