# Body Animation in VR

In this module you will learn about the role of the body in social interaction and also about how to animate and control virtual characters' body movements.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand body language and how it is used in interaction
- Explain skeletal animation
- Compare different methods for motion capture for the body
- Finding mocap data from Unity Asset Store
- Apply motion catpured data in Unity
