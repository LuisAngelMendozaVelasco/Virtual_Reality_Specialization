# Where can you find Mocap data

The best place to start looking for mocap data is the unity asset store, under the animation->bipedal category:

https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/search/page=1/sortby=popularity/query=category:138

Anything on the asset store is guaranteed to work with unity. 

Turbosquid has a selection of animations, which are in fbx format and so should work in unity:

The CMU mocap database is a large database of free mocap, but it isn't in fbx format so you will need another piece of software to convert it:
