# The Psychology of VR: the Three Illusions

In this week, Professor Mel Slater will take us through the Three Illusions. Weâ€™ll discuss Place Illusion, Plausibility Illusion, and Embodiment Illusion, with some interesting tricks along the way!

## Learning Objectives

- Compare the level of immersion between two VR systems
- Define the three illusions in Virtual Reality
- Explain how place illusion work
- Discuss plausibility illusion in VR
- Discuss bodyownership (or embodiment) illusion and its applications
